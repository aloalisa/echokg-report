# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Echocardiographic Data

This project aims to predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases in patients by classifying echocardiographic data using various machine learning algorithms. The project compares the performance of different algorithms to determine the most accurate model for predicting cardiovascular conditions based on echocardiographic measurements.

## Features
- **Data Processing:** Preprocessing of echocardiographic data, including normalization, feature selection, and handling missing data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Multiple classification algorithms are implemented and compared, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - Neural Networks

## Objectives
- To predict cardiovascular disease risk in patients using echocardiographic data.
- To compare various machine learning algorithms and identify the best-performing model for this classification task.

## Data
The dataset used contains echocardiographic data from patients, which includes measurements such as:
- Ejection fraction
- Left ventricular dimensions
- Valve conditions
- Heart rate
